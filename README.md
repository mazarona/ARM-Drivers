# Requirements

Control blinking of an LED for a user-defined ON and OFF periods.

Create a function in the App layer that takes as an input from the user a specific ON time and OFF time in seconds, lights a LED for the given ON time, and dim it for the given OFF time. Itâ€™s prohibited to use predefined delay functions, only timer driver functions can be used. This function implements implicitly the PWM module using Timer Overflow.
